    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will implement a streaming video server and client that communicate using the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and send data using the Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP). Your task is to implement the RTSP protocol in the client and implement the RTP packetization in the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide you code that implements the RTSP protocol in the server, the RTP de-packetization in the client, and takes care of displaying the transmitted video.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab requires you to compose new python code.  A skeleton framework is given, you will need to fill in the blanks. \n",

    "The ClientLauncher starts the Client and the user interface which you use to send RTSP commands and which is used to display the video. In the Client class, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">**you will need to implement the actions that are taken when the buttons are pressed**</span>. **You do not need to modify the ClientLauncher module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ServerWorker, Server\n",
    "\n",
    "These two modules implement the server which responds to the RTSP requests and streams back the video. The RTSP interaction is already implemented and the ServerWorker calls methods from the RtpPacket class to packetize the video data. **You do not need to modify these modules**.\n",

    "#### RtpPacket\n",
    "\n",
    "This python class is used to handle the RTP packets. It has separate methods for handling the received packets at the client side and **you do not need to modify them**. The Client also de-packetizes (decodes) the data and **you do not need to modify this method**. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">**You will need to complete the implementation of video data RTP- packetization (which is used by the server)**.</span>\n",

    "### Running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "After saving the files and completing your changes to the code, you can run it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, start the server with the command \n",
    "\n",
    "**`python Server.py server_port`**\n",
    "\n",
    "where server_port is the port your server listens to for incoming RTSP connections. The standard RTSP port is 554, but you will need to choose a port number greater than 1024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, start the client with the command\n",
    "\n",
    "**`python ClientLauncher.py server_host server_port RTP_port video_file`**\n",
    "\n",
    "where server_host is the name of the machine where the server is running, server_port is the port where the server is listening on, RTP_port is the port where the RTP packets are received, and video_file is the name of the video file you want to request (we have provided one example file **`movie.Mjpeg`**). The file format is described in Appendix section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client opens a connection to the server and pops up a window like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs457/images/jupyter/videoBrowser.png\" width=\"600px\" alt=\"video viewer application\" />\n",
    "    \n",
    " You can send RTSP commands to the server by pressing the buttons. A normal RTSP interaction goes as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. The client sends SETUP. This command is used to set up the session and transport parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The client sends PLAY. This command starts the playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The client may send PAUSE if it wants to pause during playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The client sends TEARDOWN. This command terminates the session and closes the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server always replies to all the messages that the client sends. The code 200 means that the request was successful while the codes 404 and 500 represent FILE_NOT_FOUND error and connection error respectively. In this lab, you do not need to implement any other reply codes. For more information about RTSP, please see RFC 2326."

    "\n",
    "Your first task is to implement the RTSP protocol on the client side. To do this, you need to complete the functions that are called when the user clicks on the buttons on the user interface. You will need to implement the actions for the following request types.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Read the server’s response and parse the Session header (from the response) to get the RTSP\n",
    "session ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a datagram socket for receiving RTP data and set the timeout on the socket to 0.5 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PLAY**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Send PLAY request. You must insert the Session header and use the session ID returned in the\n",
    "SETUP response. You must not put the Transport header in this request.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Note: You must insert the CSeq header in every request you send. The value of the CSeq header is a number which starts at 1 and is incremented by one for each request you send.*\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is a sample interaction between the client and server. The client's requests are marked with C: and server's replies with S:. In this lab both the client and the server do not use sophisticated parsing methods, and they expect the header fields to be in the order you see below.\n",

    "### The Server\n",
    "\n",
    "On the server side, you will need to implement the packetization of the video data into RTP packets. You will need to create the packet, set the fields in the packet header and copy the payload (i.e., one video frame) into the packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the server receives the PLAY-request from the client, the server reads one video frame from the file and creates an RtpPacket-object which is the RTP-encapsulation of the video frame. It then sends the frame to the client over UDP every 50 milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the encapsulation, the server calls the encode function of the RtpPacket class. Your task is to write this function. You will need to do the following: (the letters in parenthesis refer to the fields in the RTP packet format below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set the RTP-version field (V). You must set this to 2.\n",
    "* Set padding (P), extension (X), number of contributing sources (CC), and marker (M) fields.\n",
    "These are all set to zero in this lab.\n",
    "* Set payload type field (PT). In this lab we use MJPEG and the type for that is 26.\n",
    "* Set the sequence number. The server gives this the sequence number as the frameNbr argument to\n",
    "the encode function.\n",
    "* Set the timestamp using the Python’s time module.\n",
    "* Set the source identifier (SSRC). This field identifies the server. You can pick any integer value you like.\n",
    "* Because we have no other contributing sources (field CC == 0), the CSRC-field does not exist. The length of the packet header is therefore 12 bytes, or the first three lines from the diagram below.\n",

In the examples below, the bit numbers refer to the numbers in the above diagram.\n",

    "```\n",
